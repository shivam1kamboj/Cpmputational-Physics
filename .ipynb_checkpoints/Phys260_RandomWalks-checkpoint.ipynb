    "Notice how the MSD might saturate above because of confinement. We need a smaller velocity or larger box or periodic boundary conditions to get the full range of MSD. Or we could just do an unrestricted ABP walk without any confining box. Try any of these methods to get a characteristic MSD which clearly shows the expected ballistic and diffusive regimes of the ABP model. Make sure to include enough statistics (i.e. enough number of walkers and number of steps)."
